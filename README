usage:
  ./spead 
    -w [workers (d:4)] 
    -p [port (d:8888)] 
    -b [buffers (d:10)] 
    -l [buffer length (d:10)]

This is a multicore implementation of the Streaming Protocol for Exchange of Astronomy Data (SPEAD).

Workers refer to subprocesses used to capture and process UDP packets. Defaults to amount of processor cores

Port (duh)

Buffers can be thought of as hash tables where packets will be inserted which are backed by linked lists.
  b defines the amount of the hash tables 
  l defines the length of the hash tables
